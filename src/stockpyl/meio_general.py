Overview 
--------

For MEIO systems with arbitrary topology (not necessarily serial or tree systems),
the |mod_meio_general| module can optimize base-stock levels approximately using
relatively brute-force approachesâ€”either coordinate descent or enumeration. These
heuristics tend to be quite slow and not particularly accurate, but they are sometimes
the best methods available for complex systems that are not well solved in the literature.

	base-stock levels. Evaluate each combination using the provided objective
	function, or simulation if not provided.

	Parameters
	----------
	network : |class_network|
		The network to optimize.
	base_stock_levels : dict, optional
		A dictionary indicating, for each node index, the base-stock levels to
		test in the enumeration. Example: {0: [0, 5, 10, 15], 1: [0, 2, 4, 6]}.
	truncation_lo : float or dict, optional
		A float or dictionary indicating, for each node index, the low end of the
		truncation range for values to test for that node. If float,
		the same value is used for every node. If omitted, it is set automatically.
	truncation_hi : float or dict, optional
		A dictionary indicating, for each node index, the high end of the
		truncation range for values levels to test for that node. If float,
		the same value is used for every node. If omitted, it is set automatically.
	discretization_step : float or dict, optional
		A dictionary indicating, for each node index, the interval width to use
		for discretization of the values to test for that node. If float,
		the same value is used for every node. If omitted, it is set automatically.
	discretization_num : int or dict, optional
		A dictionary indicating, for each node index, the number of intervals to use
		for discretization of the values to test for that node. If int,
		the same value is used for every node. If omitted, it is set automatically.
		Ignored if ``discretization_step`` is provided.
	groups : list of sets, optional
		A list of sets, each of which contains indices of nodes that should have the
		same base-stock level. This speeds the optimization since the base-stock
		levels for the nodes in a given group do not have to be optimized individually.
		Any nodes not contained in any set in the list are optimized individually.
		If omitted, all nodes are optimized individually.
	objective_function : function, optional
		The function to use to evaluate a given solution. The function must take
		a single argument, the dictionary of base-stock levels, and return a
		single output, the expected cost per period. If omitted, simulation
		will be used.
	sim_num_trials : int, optional
		Number of trials to run in each simulation. Ignored if ``objective_function``
		is provided.
	sim_num_periods : int, optional
		Number of periods per trial in each simulation. Ignored if ``objective_function``
		is provided.
	sim_rand_seed : int, optional
		Rand seed to use for simulation. Ignored if ``objective_function`` is provided.
	progress_bar : bool, optional
		Display a progress bar? Ignored if ``print_solutions`` is ``True``.
	print_solutions : bool, optional
		Print each solution and its cost?

	Returns
	-------
	best_S : dict
		Dict of best base-stock levels found.
