Overview 
--------

The |mod_instances| module contains code for loading and saving problem instances.

.. note:: |fosct_notation| 

	The abbreviation *SCMO* below refers to the textbook
	*Supply Chain Modeling and Optimization* by Snyder, Smilowitz, and Shen, forthcoming.

|sp| has a number of built-in instances, most (but not all) of which are taken from |fosct|.
These can be loaded using the :func:`~load_instance` function by providing the instance name. 
A list of the built-in instances is provided below.

def load_instance(instance_name, filepath=None, ignore_state_vars=True):
	"""Load an instance from a JSON file. 

	If the instance was originally specified as a |class_network| object, returns the
	object; otherwise, returns the instance in a dictionary.

	Parameters
	----------
	instance_name : str
		The name of the instance.
	filepath : str, optional
		Path to the JSON file. If ``None``, the function determines the path to 
		``datasets/stockpyl_instances.json``.
	ignore_state_vars : bool, optional
		If ``True``, function will ignore any saved state variables in the nodes.

	Returns
	-------
	dict or |class_network|
		The loaded instance. If the instance was originally specified as a |class_network|
		object, returns the object; otherwise, returns the instance in a dictionary in which
		the keys equal the parameter names (e.g., "holding_cost") and the values equal the parameter
		values (e.g., 0.5).

	Raises
	------
	ValueError
		If the JSON file does not exist or the instance cannot be found in the JSON file.
