# Changelog

All significant changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Option to suppress dummy-product indices in simulation output.
- ``SupplyChainNetwork.nodes_by_index`` dict, which returns a ``SupplyChainNode`` object for a given index.
Use this in place of ``SupplyChainNetwork.get_node_from_index()``, which will be deprecated.

### Changed
- Various speedups.

### Fixed
- Bug that caused ``mwor_system()`` to crash when ``demand_source`` is provided as argument 
[#146](https://github.com/LarrySnyder/stockpyl/issues/146).

## [1.0.0] -- 2024-05-13

### Introducing: Products
- Stockpyl now supports *products* in simulations. Products are implemented using the ``supply_chain_product``
object. 
- Products are "handled" by nodes. Most attributes (``stockout_cost``, 
``inventory_policy``, etc.) may be specified either at the node level, the product 
level, or the (node, product) level.
- Products are related to each other via a bill of materials (BOM), which specifies
the number of units of an upstream product (*raw material*) that are required to make
one unit of a downstream product (*finished goods*). 
- Only the simulation features of Stockpyl can currently make use of products; MEIO and other features
still assume a single-product model.
- For more information about creating and managing products, and simulating multi-product systems in |sp|, see the [``supply_chain_product``](https://stockpyl.readthedocs.io/en/multiproduct/api/datatypes/supply_chain_product.html) module or 
the [tutorial page for multi-product simulation](tutorial_multiproduct_sim_page).

### Added
- Products.
- ``helpers.nearest_dict_value()`` function, to find key in a dictionary that's nearest to
a given number and return the corresponding value.
- ``loss_functions.standard_normal_loss_dict()`` function, to build a dictionary of loss-function values.
- Support for negative binomial demand distributions in ``DemandSource``.
- Functions to validate and parse nodes and products within a network or node. (Mostly used internally for simulation.)

### Changed
- Requires Python 3.8 or later.
- Default git branch has been [changed to ``main``](https://sfconservancy.org/news/2020/jun/23/gitbranchname/).
If you have a local clone, you can rename it using:

	```
	git branch -m master main
	git fetch origin
	git branch -u origin/main main
	git remote set-head origin -a
	```

- ``NodeStateVars.raw_material_inventory`` is now indexed by product, not by predecessor.
- ``NodeStateVars`` object is now in its own module, ``node_state_vars.py``, rather than in ``supply_chain_node.py``.
- ``NodeStateVars`` attributes should now be accessed using the appropriate methods, rather than using
the attribute directly. For example: use ``node.state_vars[42].get_outbound_shipment(successor, product)`` instead
of ``node.state_vars[42].outbound_shipment[successor][product]``. These methods allow you to omit product info if
it is inferrable. (This is especially useful for models that don't have products explicitly added.)
- More compact text representation of ``SupplyChainNetwork`` and ``SupplyChainNode`` objects via ``__repr__()``.

### Fixed
- ``supply_chain_network.network_from_edges()`` now only creates a ``DemandSource`` for sink nodes or if the
demand source parameters were provided specifically for that node in the input args.
- Bug in ``helpers.ensure_list_for_time_period()`` that caused it to handle numpy arrays improperly.
- Bug in ``demand_source.py`` that sometimes caused infinite recursion when some attributes were ``None``.
- Bug in ``sim_io.py`` that caused incorrect headers for a few state variables.
- Various other bug fixes.

### Known Issues
(See https://github.com/LarrySnyder/stockpyl/issues for all issues.)
- BOM relationships assume the products are infinitely divisible; e.g., if 5 units of product A are
required to make 1 unit of product B, and there are 4 units of product A available, then 0.8 units of
product B are produced. [#155](https://github.com/LarrySnyder/stockpyl/issues/155)
- Lead times are specific to downstream node and finished good product, not upstream node and raw material.
This makes it hard to have different lead times for ordering different raw materials from different upstream nodes. [#149](https://github.com/LarrySnyder/stockpyl/issues/149)
- Echelon base-stock policies are not working reliably yet, at least for systems with multiple products. [#153](https://github.com/LarrySnyder/stockpyl/issues/153)
- Disruptions can only occur at node level, not product level. [#158](https://github.com/LarrySnyder/stockpyl/issues/158)

## [0.0.15] -- 2024-02-10

### Added
- Tutorial, in Jupyter notebook form, to accompany Snyder, L. V., "[Stockpyl: A Python Package for Inventory Optimization and Simulation](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/10.1287/educ.2023.0256)," in: Bish, E. K. and H. Balasubramanian, INFORMS TutORials in Operations Research, 156â€“197, 2023
- Check to make sure that a node's ``inventory_policy`` attribute is set, and that the ``Policy`` object's ``node`` attribute is set to the node
- Set the ``Policy`` object's ``node`` attribute automatically when setting the node's ``inventory_policy`` to it 
- Ability to print simulation output table to text file (in addition to CSV option)
- ``order_capacity`` attribute for ``SupplyChainNode``, which is respected in simulation

### Changed
- Changes to ``optimize_base_stock_levels()`` in ``ssm_serial`` that result in large speedups in some cases (via @DominikKamp)
- Add vertical line between nodes in simulation output to make it easier to separate nodes visually
- Minor edits to documentation and README

### Fixed
- Incorrect handling of custom demand distributions in ``ss.s_s_discrete_exact()``
- Error in unit tests for ``meio_general.truncate_and_discretize()``
