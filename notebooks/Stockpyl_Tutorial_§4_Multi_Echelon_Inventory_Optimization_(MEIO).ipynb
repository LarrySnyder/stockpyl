        "# Section 4: Multi-Echelon Inventory Optimization (MEIO)\n",
        "\n",
        "Multi-echelon inventory optimization (MEIO) is significantly more difficult than single-echelon problems, primarily because a given node or stage (we use the terms interchangeably) experiences stochastic lead times from its upstream nodes, even if the transportation lead time is deterministic, due to random stockouts at the upstream nodes. Moreover, the probability distribution of the lead time depends on the base-stock levels (or other inventory policy parameters) at the upstream nodes, but the optimal upstream base-stock levels depend on the optimal downstream base-stock levels, which in turn depend on the probability distribution of the lead times. This vicious cycle makes it difficult even to calculate the expected cost of a given set of base-stock levels, let alone optimize them.\n",
        "\n",
        "Two primary types of models have been developed to deal with this issue. _Stochastic-service models_ (SSM) assume that each stage meets the demand from stock whenever possible and experiences stockouts otherwise, much like the newsvendor and other single-stage problems. The upstream lead times will be stochastic due to stockouts, and the expected cost function must account for these lead times either exactly or approximately, leading to considerable challenges in both formulating the expected cost and optimizing it. This is the approach taken in the seminal paper by Clark and Scarf (1960) and many subsequent works.\n",
        "\n",
        "In contrast, _guaranteeed-service models_ (GSM) assume that each stage provides a deterministic upper bound on its outbound lead time. In particular, each stage sets a _committed service time_ (CST) and guarantees that it will satisfy every demand within that CST. This allows a more tractable formulation of the MEIO problem since the upstream lead times are now deterministic. On the other hand, the tractability comes at an expense, in the form of a relatively strong assumption that the customer demand is bounded. There is a one-to-one relationship between a set of CSTs, one for each node, and a set of corresponding base-stock levels. Therefore, if we think of SSM as a more accurate model of real-world inventory systems (a claim that is open to debate, see, e.g., Graves and Willems 2003), the GSM approach can be viewed as a heuristic for setting base-stock levels in an SSM system. The GSM approach was pioneered by Kimball (1988) and Simpson (1958), and brought into more widespread use by Graves and Willems (2000).\n",

        "In a serial system indexed $N \\to N-1 \\to \\cdots \\to 1$, the _echelon_ of stage $j$ is defined as stage $j$ and all stages downstream from $j$. The _echelon inventory level_, $IL_j$, consists of all items on hand in stages $j,\\ldots,1$, plus all items in transit between those stages, minus backorders at stage 1. Echelon-based quantities such as these are less intuitive than the _local_ quantities we typically deal with, but they are more convenient mathematically, and the functions described in Section 4.3 use them.\n",

        "The _local holding cost_ at stage $j$, denoted $h'_j$, is the holding cost charged based on on-hand inventory at stage $j$ (sometimes plus items in transit from stage $j$ to $j-1$). This type of holding cost is intuitive, and is analogous to the holding cost in single-stage problems. On the other hand, in SSM models, it is often convenient to work with the _echelon holding cost_, denoted $h_j$ and defined as\n",

Typically, echelon holding costs are non-negative (meaning the value of the product, or the cost to store it, increases as we move downstream), since local holding costs tend to increase as we move downstream. However, negative echelon holding costs are possible.\n",

Echelon base-stock policies are closely related to the more familiar _local base-stock policies_, in which we bring the local inventory position up to the local base-stock level.

        "GSM models assume a periodic-review system in which each stage follows a local base-stock policy. In GSM systems, we assume that each stage offers a _committed service time_ (CST) to its customers (which may be downstream stages or external demands) within which it promises to satisfy each order. The CSTs are the decision variables in the optimization model. To ensure that each stage meets its CST, the GSM model assumes that the external demands are bounded. In particular, if the demands in one time period are distributed as $N(\\mu,\\sigma^2)$, then we assume that the total demand in any $\\tau$ time periods is less than or equal to\n",
        "$$D(\\tau) = \\mu\\tau + z_\\alpha\\sigma\\sqrt{\\tau}$$\n",
        "for some constant $\\alpha$. If the demand in a given $\\tau$-period interval exceeds $D(\\tau)$, the excess demands are assumed to be handled outside the system, e.g., by outsourcing.\n",
        "\n",
        "> **Remark:** It is tempting to set $\\alpha$ to something large so that the demand bound is quite loose and the demand model is more accurate. However, as we will see below, the base-stock levels are directly related to $\\alpha$, so setting $\\alpha$ to a large value will also result in unnecessarily large base-stock levels and resulting holding costs. This tension is one of the main disadvantages of the GSM approach.\n",
        "\n",
        "The GSM approach was first discussed by Kimball (1988). Simpson (1958) applied it to serial systems, and Inderfurth (1991) (see also Graves 1988) discussed how to solve it using dynamic programming (DP); this is the basis for the approach implemented in the [`gsm_serial`](https://stockpyl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/meio/gsm_serial.html) module. For pure assembly and distribution systems, see Inderfurth (1991), Minner (1997), and Inderfurth and Minner (1998). Graves and Willems (2000) present a DP model for tree systems, that is, networks that have no directed cycles; this is the algorithm implemented in the [`gsm_tree`](https://stockpyl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/meio/gsm_tree.html) module. Magnanti, et al. (2006) present a MIP-based model for solving general systems."
