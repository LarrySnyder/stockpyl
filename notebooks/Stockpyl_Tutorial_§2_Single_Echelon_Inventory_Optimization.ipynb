        "\n",
        "The `eoq` module contains code for solving the economic order quantity (EOQ) problem and some of its variants. The EOQ problem is arguably the oldest and simplest inventory optimization problem, dating back to Harris (1913). The problem assumes that the demand is continuous, deterministic, and constant, and that there is a fixed cost to place an order and a holding cost to store inventory. The goal of the problem is to determine the optimal order quantity to use for each order. Many variants of the EOQ have been proposed in the literature, and Stockpyl implements some of the more common ones.\n",
        "\n",
        "The main function in the module is the [`economic_order_quantity()`](https://stockpyl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/seio/eoq.html#stockpyl.eoq.economic_order_quantity) function, which implements the basic EOQ model (Harris 1913; _FoSCT_ §3.2).\n",
        "\n",
        "The function has the signature\n",

        "> **Remark:** The functions in the `newsvendor` module solve either the single-period newsvendor problem, or its infinite-horizon analogue. In the infinite-horizon version, unsold items may be held from one period to the next in the form of inventory (incurring a holding cost), and unmet demands may be held from one period to the next in the form of backorders (incurring a stockout cost). We use the term \"newsvendor\" to refer to both the single-period and infinite-horizon problems, since they are mathematically equivalent. However, some authors prefer not to use the term \"newsvendor\" to describe the infinite-horizon problem. That problem may alternatively be called the _base-stock optimization problem_, since the firm is following a base-stock policy and the objective is to find the optimal base-stock level.\n",
