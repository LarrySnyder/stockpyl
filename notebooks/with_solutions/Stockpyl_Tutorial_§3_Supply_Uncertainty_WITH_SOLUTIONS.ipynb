        "# Section 3: Supply Uncertainty\n",
        "\n",
        "The literature on inventory optimization with supply uncertainty considers two main types of supply uncertainty: disruptions (in which the supplier is unavailable for a random period of time) and yield uncertainty (in which the quantity delivered differs randomly from the quantity ordered). (Other forms of supply uncertainty, such as lead time uncertainty or capacity uncertainty, are somewhat less well-studied in the literature, and are not implemented in Stockpyl.)\n",
        "In particular, the `supply_uncertainty` module in Stockpyl implements the following:\n",
        "\n",
        "* The economic order quantity (EOQ) model with disruptions (Section 3.1.1)\n",
        "* The economic order quantity (EOQ) model with yield uncertainty (Section 3.1.2)\n",
        "* The newsvendor model with disruptions (Section 3.2.1)\n",
        "* The newsvendor with yield uncertainty (Section 3.2.2)\n",
        "\n",
        "The models implemented in Stockpyl (and most inventory models with disruptions) treat disruptions as binary events---either the supplier is completely disrupted and cannot supply any items, or it is completely operational and has infinite supply available. The supplier's status is governed by a 2-state Markov chain, with the `UP` and `DOWN` states indicating that the supplier is operational or disrupted, respectively. For continuous-review inventory models (EOQ), we use a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) with given transition rates, and for periodic-review models (newsvendor), we use a discrete-time Markov chain (DTMC) with given transition probabilties. These are discussed in more detail in Sections 3.1.1 and 3.2.1. For reviews of inventory models with disruptions, see Atan and Snyder (2012) or Snyder, et al. (2016).\n",
        "\n",
        "In contrast, yield uncertainty assumes that the supplier is always operational, but the quantity delivered differs from the quantity ordered by a random amount. Stockpyl handles two common types of yield uncertainty, additive and multiplicative. In additive yield uncertainty, if we order $Q$ units, we receive $Q+Y$, where $Y$ is a random variable. In multiplicative yield uncertainty, we receive $QZ$ units, where $Z$ is a random variable. In both cases, the probability distribution of the yield ($Y$ or $Z$) is assumed to be known, analogous to the case of demand uncertainty. Sometimes, restrictions are placed on the yield random variables; for example, we might assume $Y \\le 0$ or $Z \\le 1$ to ensure that the quantity received is not greater than the quantity ordered. (This is realistic in some settings but not in others; for example, in agriculture or chemical manufacturing, the yield is sometimes larger than intended.) However, Stockpyl does not impose such restrictions; if restrictions are required, they should be incorporated into the distribution information passed to the functions. For reviews of inventory models with yield uncertainty, see Grosfeld Nir and Gerchak (2004) or Yano and Lee (1995).\n",

        "The EOQ problem with disruptions (EOQD; _FoSCT_ §9.2.1) assumes that the supplier can be disrupted randomly, according to a 2-state CTMC. The CTMC transitions from the `UP` state to the `DOWN` state with rate $\\lambda$, known as the _disruption rate_, and from the `DOWN` state to the `UP` state with rate $\\mu$, the _recovery rate_. Therefore, the length of a given `UP` (non-disrupted) interval is exponentially distributed with a mean of $1/\\lambda$, and the length of a given `DOWN` (disrupted) interval is exponentially distributed with a mean of $1/\\mu$. Demand is constant and deterministic, as in the classical EOQ. Inventory may be depleted during a `DOWN` interval, in which case unmet demands are lost.\n",

        "We now turn our attention to newsvendor problems with supply uncertainty. These problems assume that the demand is deterministic but the supply is stochastic (the opposite of the classical newsvendor problem). We consider an infinite-horizon model in which inventory may be carried from one time period to the next (at a holding cost of $h$ per item per period), and unmet demands may be carried from one period to the next in the form of backorders (at a stockout cost of $p$ per item per period).\n",
        "\n",
        "> **Remark:** The newsvendor problem with disruptions is an infinite-horizon problem; it does not make sense to consider this problem in a single-period setting since the only reason to order extra inventory in a given period is to protect against disruptions in future periods. The newsvendor problem with yield uncertainty may be interpreted as either a single-period or infinite-horizon problem. As discussed in Section 1, we use the term \"newsvendor\" to describe both the single-period and infinite-horizon problems."

        "\n",
        "The newsvendor problem with disruptions (Güllu, Onol, and Erkip 1997; Tomlin 2005 [unabridged version]; Schmitt and Snyder 2012; _FoSCT_ §9.2.2)  assumes that the supplier's disruptions follow a 2-state DTMC. If the supplier is in the `UP` state, it transitions to the `DOWN` state with probability $\\alpha$ (called the _disruption probability_) and remains `UP` with probability $1-\\alpha$. If it is in the `DOWN` state, it transitions to `UP` with probability $\\beta$ (the _recovery probability_) and remains `DOWN` with probability $1-\\beta$. Therefore, the length of a given `UP` (non-disrupted) interval has a geometric distribution with mean $1/\\alpha$, and the length of a given `DOWN` (disrupted) interval is geometrically distributed with mean $1/\\beta$. Inventory may be depleted during a `DOWN` interval, in which case unmet demands are lost. A base-stock policy is optimal (with the modification that the firm orders nothing during `DOWN` periods), and our goal is to determine the optimal base-stock level.\n",
